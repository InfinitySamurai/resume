# Activites

### Technology based

* As part of my computing hobby, I frequently assess and troubleshoot hardware
  and software systems
* I enjoy playing with electronics and have built a fully functioning LED cube,
  controlled by an Arduino micro controller
* I design and implement my own computer games using various frameworks such as
  Monogame and PixiJS, requiring sound knowledge of 2D space.
* Using these frameworks, I frequently explore and use documentation to build
  my ideas. When novel problems arise, I use my own ingenuity to create
  solutions.
* I have taught myself R to contribute to statistical analysis and data
  handling for graduate research
* I have created and managed my own game servers, requiring both management of
  server infrastructure, and administration of the player base to ensure
  enjoyment by all players.
