# Soft Skills

### Communication

I am adept at communicating to a range of different audiences through various
different communication channels.

* Talking with parents of students so they understand what their child has been
  and will be achieving in Invent the World's Coding Clubs and courses. This
  was integral to the company's continued income through new and retained
  students, and therefore my job stability
* Talking with parents over email and phone to answer queries about Invent the
  World and their services, success again being integral to the companies
  income and my job stability
* Communicating programming concepts to students between the ages of 5 and 14,
  as well as making sure that students are comfortable and having fun throughout
  Invent the World's Coding Clubs and courses
* Performing the same communication as above, but with students that have
  learning difficulties.
* Training new staff members at Invent the World both in the classroom and over
  the phone to ensure that they understood what was expected of them and how
  classrooms and behaviour management was handled
* Tracking issues through Gitlab and effectively conveying what the issue is,
  what is going wrong, how it should be acting, potential causes, and potential
  solutions
* Teaching programming and IT concepts to first year university students both
  in the classroom and through email correspondence. Also using other time/task
  management tools to ensure students' are on track for projects
* One on one tutoring with university students

### Teamwork

Teamwork is a day to day occurrence, and something that I am proficient at

* For team based projects at Invent the World, I made sure that any tasks
  assigned to me were complete by due dates so that other staff could complete
  their work on time.
* Working in a classroom with another staff member required co-ordination to
  make sure that all students got the attention they required, as well as
  efficient set-up and pack-up.
* Working on Git projects both in my own time and through Invent the World
  required good communication and the use of organizational tools to make sure that issues were
  raised and addressed in a timely fashion
