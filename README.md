# Russell's experience

## A repository for all of my experience: work, hobbies and education

This is a place for me to store all the stuff that I know. Typically i forget a
lot of the experience that I have, and this is going to be my place that I can
refer back to when I feel like I don't know anything, or if I'm building a
resume.

Strangely enough, I don't mind issues or pull requests. If you find something
that isn't worded well, or a spelling mistake, please let me know!
